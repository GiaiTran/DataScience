# CMC-Classification
This project is a part of Data Science I- COSC3337-Group4 
(https://github.com/thieny1991/DataScience).

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to apply different classification techniques to a chalange dataset, to compare the result, to potentially enhance the accuracy of the learnt models via selecting better parameters/ preprocessing/ using kernels/ incorportating background knowledge and to summarize our findings in a report. The challenge data set that our group will work on is Contraceptive Method Choice data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice)
### Steps:
    1. Preprocessing
    2. Data Generation
    3. Data Exploration
    4. Neural Networks Classifier
    5. SVM Classifier
    6. KNN Classifier
    7. Random Forest Classifier

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Newral Networks
* Grid Search technique for hyperparameter tuning
* Support Vector Machines
* KNN
* Random Forest


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter,sklearn
* Colab
* Git

## Project Description
    This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive
    Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not 
    pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The 
    problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice 
    (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based 
    on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
    Based on the given data set, our project will go through all neccessary steps to analize  the 4 listed classification methods and compare their results in order to come up with the best fit classification.   

## Needs of this project
